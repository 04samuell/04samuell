### ANDIE

An image editor made entirely in java. This was a university group project made by myself and four others. In this application you can upload an image and modify it with a variety of filters and other tools. The source code isn't available but please read the attached README for usage.

### Chaos Game

A project to explore some fractal. Fractals are something that I have found really intersting and was really eager to use my skills to visualise how a few simple procedures produce complex, beautiful patterns.

### Falling Sand

My first project entirely coded from scratch. This project is an interactive application to simulate some falling sand. I did this so as to familiarise myself with tools such as version control, using the terminal, Gradle, and creating jar files.
